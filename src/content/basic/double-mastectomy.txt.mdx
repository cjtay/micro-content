When both breasts are removed, it is called a double (or bilateral) mastectomy. A double mastectomy is often a risk-reducing (or preventive) surgery.

Most of these mastectomies are simple mastectomies, but some may be nipple-sparing. In other situations, a double mastectomy might be done as part of a women's breast cancer treatment plan. This is done after careful consideration and discussion between the patient and their cancer care team.
