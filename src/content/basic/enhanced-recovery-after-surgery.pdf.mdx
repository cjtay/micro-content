Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (called "ERAS") is a care plan that was made for you by your Surgery and Anaesthesiology Teams of NCIS.

This plan helps to: Get your body ready for surgery, get well safely, and return home as soon as possible after your surgery.

ERAS represents a new way of thinking about how we look after patients undergoing major surgery.

It helps patients recover from their operation sooner, so that life can return to normal as quickly as possible. ERAS is a treatment programme made up of a number of different elements based on the best available medical science. It also focuses on making sure you are actively involved in your recovery.

The main aspects are planning and preparation before admission (including improving your nutrition and physical fitness before surgery); reducing the physical stress of the operation; a structured approach to management during your hospital stay (including pain relief and early nutrition); and getting you moving as soon as possible.

## Why use ERAS?

Numerous research reports have shown that employing ERAS as opposed to traditional care has marked effects on recovery. In many surgeries, recovery time can be shortened by 30% or more and complication rates after the operation by at least as much.

Patients undergoing gynaecological and gynaecological oncology procedures can have prolonged recovery in the critical period after surgery and prior to discharge from the hospital.

The significant factors that traditionally influence recovery in this period include postoperative pain control, fluid management, and the return of bowel function.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols are designed to address these issues and help you recover faster and more comfortably. These protocols have been studied in many hospitals and are shown to improve surgical outcomes, decrease hospital length of stay, and improve patient satisfaction. Our protocol is designed with the help of your surgeon, anaesthesiologist, care team, and nurses to provide you with the best care.

### 1 - Before Surgery

- Going into surgery as healthy as possible (e.g. increase activity/exercise, stop smoking)
- Decreasing the amount of time you go without eating
- Start pain control before the surgery takes place

### 2 - During Surgery

- Using many types of medications to control pain and give a reasonable amount of intravenous fluid to keep you hydrated
- Minimally invasive surgery

### 3 - After Surgery

- Getting out of bed and walking early and often
- Allowing you to eat as soon as safely possible
- Avoiding excessive intravenous fluid
- Controlling your pain using different types of medications in addition to narcotics
- Good pain control with oral medications
- Eating and drinking without difficulty or nausea
- The ability to walk and move around safely
