A modified radical mastectomy combines a simple mastectomy with removing the lymph nodes under the arm.

## Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)

In this procedure, anywhere from about 10 to 40 (though usually less than 20) lymph nodes are removed from the area under the arm (axilla) and checked for cancer spread. ALND is usually done at the same time as a mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery (BCS), but it can be done in a second operation.

ALND may be needed if:

- If a previous SLNB has shown three or more of the underarm lymph nodes have cancer cells
- If swollen underarm or collarbone, lymph nodes can be felt before surgery or seen on imaging tests and an FNA or core needle biopsy shows cancer.
- If cancer has grown large enough to extend outside the lymph node(s)
- If the SLNB is positive for cancer cells after chemotherapy was given to shrink the tumour before surgery
