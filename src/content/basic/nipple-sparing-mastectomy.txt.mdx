A nipple-sparing mastectomy is similar to a skin-sparing mastectomy in that the breast tissue is removed, and the breast skin is saved. But in this procedure, the nipple and areola are left in place. This can be followed by breast reconstruction.

The surgeon often removes the breast tissue under the nipple and areola during the procedure to check for cancer cells. If cancer is found in this tissue, the nipple and areola must be removed.

This type of mastectomy is often an option for women with a small, early-stage cancer, away (more than 2cm) from the nipple and areola, with no signs of cancer in the skin or the nipple.

As with any surgery, there are risks. After the surgery, the nipple may not have a good blood supply, causing the tissue to shrink or become deformed. Because the nerves are also cut, there often may be little or no feeling left in the nipple. If a woman has larger breasts, the nipple may look out of place after the breast is reconstructed. As a result, many doctors feel this surgery is best done in women with small to medium-sized breasts. This procedure leaves fewer scars you can see, but it also risks leaving behind more breast tissue than other forms of mastectomy. This could result in a higher risk of cancer developing than for a skin-sparing or simple mastectomy. However, improvements in technique have helped lower this risk, and the risk of cancer coming back in the same area is about the same as with other types of mastectomies. Most experts consider nipple-sparing mastectomy to be an acceptable treatment for breast cancer in some instances.
