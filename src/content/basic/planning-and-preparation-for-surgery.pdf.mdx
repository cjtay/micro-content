Although each person's situation is different, here is a general overview of what may happen before surgery.

Your doctor will ask you to complete a questionnaire about your medical history, including any allergies and medicines you take. Depending on your surgery and general health, you may have to attend a pre-admission clinic a few weeks before the surgery. This is so your medical team can check your fitness for surgery and recommend any tests or other things you need to do to prepare for surgery and ensure the best outcomes.

Tell the doctor if you are taking over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbs or other supplements, as these could affect the surgery and your recovery. For example, they may increase the risk of bleeding during surgery or affect how pain medicines work.
