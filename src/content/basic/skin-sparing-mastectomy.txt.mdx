In this procedure, most of the skin over the breast is left in place. Only the breast tissue, nipple, and areola are removed. The amount of breast tissue removed is the same as a simple mastectomy.

Many women prefer a skin-sparing mastectomy because it offers the advantage of less scar tissue and a reconstructed breast that seems more natural. But it may not be suitable for larger tumours or those close to the skin's surface.

The risk of local cancer recurrence with this type of mastectomy is the same as with other types of mastectomies.
