## Meet Your Anaesthetist

You will usually meet with your anaesthetist before the surgery. This might be in the few days before your surgery, especially if you have major surgery or health concerns. Usually, it will be in the hours before surgery.

By this time, he or she will clearly understand your anaesthetic needs.

### Reactions to previous anaesthetics:

If you have ever had a bad reaction to an anaesthetic agent, you need to be able to describe precisely the reaction and your specific symptoms.

### Current herbal supplements:

Certain herbal products, commonly taken by millions of Americans, may cause heart rate and blood pressure changes and increase bleeding in some patients.

### Any known allergies:

Discussing known allergies with the anaesthesiologist is very important, as some anaesthetic drugs trigger cross-allergies, particularly in people allergic to eggs and soy products.

### All recent and current prescription and over-the-counter medicines:

Let your surgeon and anaesthesiologist know about prescription and over-the-counter medicines you have recently taken.

### Cigarette smoking and drinking alcohol:

Cigarette smoking and alcohol can affect your body as strongly (and sometimes more strongly) as many prescription medicines you take.
