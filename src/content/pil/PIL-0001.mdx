# Abemaciclib

## About the treatment

Abemaciclib is a selective kinase inhibitor that works as a targeted therapy. Specifically, this treatment is given to patients with breast cancer. The specific type of proteins, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK 4, 6), promote cancer cells to grow and spread. Abemaciclib slows down or stops the growth and spread of cancer cells by blocking the activity of CDK 4, 6.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
