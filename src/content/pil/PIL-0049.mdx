# Capecitabine

## About the treatment

Capecitabine (antimetabolite) is selectively tumour-sensitive, which interferes with the synthesis of DNA and RNA of cells and stops the growth and spread of cancer cells. This drug is activated by a specific enzyme more prevalent in cancer cells than in normal body cells. This single-agent treatment is given in certain conditions of breast cancer and bowel/colorectal cancer and has some other uses.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
