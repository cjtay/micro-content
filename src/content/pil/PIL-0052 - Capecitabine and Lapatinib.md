# Capecitabine and Lapatinib

### About the treatment

### Treatment details

A combination of capecitabine (antimetabolite) and lapatinib (kinase inhibitor) is a treatment option for breast cancer. Cancer medicines are often used in combination to slow down or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.

- Capecitabine is to be taken twice daily by mouth from days 1 to 14 of your 21-day cycle.
- Lapatinib is to be taken once daily by mouth from days 1 to 21 of your 21-day cycle.

### Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.

### Common Side Effects

The following side effects occur in more than 10 out of every 100 people. You might have one or more of them. Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances. Diarrhoea This treatment may disturb the intestinal lining and cause loose, watery, and more frequent stools than usual. Certain medications have a higher chance of causing diarrhoea. Hand and foot syndrome Also called palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia) is a side effect of some chemotherapy drugs that can cause  redness, swelling and blistering on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia) White blood cells (WBC) are crucial for fighting infection. While receiving treatment, your WBC count can drop, putting you at a higher risk of disease. Nausea and/or vomiting Every patient reacts differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication. Fatigue You may feel tired and find it harder to do daily chores/activities that you usually do or want to do. It may be physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) Platelets help your blood clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count decreases. Let your oncology care team know if you have any excess bruising or bleeding, including nose bleeds, sore gums or blood in your urine or stool. Low appetite Appetite loss or poor appetite are common side effects of cancer and its treatment. This means you may eat less than usual, not feel hungry, or feel full after eating only a tiny amount.

Nail changes Your nails may take on a bruised appearance, turning various shades of black, brown, purple, blue and green. Blemishes, such as horizontal and vertical lines and small indentations, may develop on your nails in response to different cycles of chemotherapy. Joint pain Pain is a common side effect of chemotherapy, and joint pain is no exception. Although it can occur anytime during treatment, it often appears afterwards and is usually resolved in weeks to months.

- If it is necessary to cut the tablets (e.g. into halves or quarters) to obtain the correct dose,

a tablet cutter should be used. Do not use the same tablet cutter to cut other medicines.

reuse these for further doses, but do not use them for other purposes.

for proper disposal. General Precautions Safe Handling of Oral Chemotherapy Medicine

Tell your healthcare team about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements, traditional Chinese medicine and over-the-counter remedies. During treatment, please do not drink the juice of the following fruits, including supplements that may contain them: grapefruit, starfruit, pomegranate and pomelo. They may interfere with the effects of drugs or cause dangerous side effects. As some treatments may weaken your immune system, avoiding raw or undercooked food such as sushi, raw meat, and runny eggs is advisable to prevent infection. Bacteria are often present in uncooked food and are usually killed by the cooking process. If your doctor determines it is safe to eat raw vegetables and fruits, they should be carefully washed. We have dietitian services that can help you plan your diet and meals. Please let a member of your healthcare team know if you are interested. This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is critical not to become pregnant while having treatment and for at least six months afterwards.
