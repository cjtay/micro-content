# Capecitabine and Radiation Therapy

### About the treatment

### Treatment details

Concurrently given with radiation, capecitabine (antimetabolite chemotherapy) is a treatment option for colorectal and some other cancers. Radiation and cancer medicines are usually used to slow or stop cancer cell growth and spread more effectively.

- Radiation will be administered over ~ 15 to 30 minutes on days 1 to 5 of your 7-day cycle.
- Capecitabine is to be taken twice a day by mouth fom days 1 to 5 of your 7-day cycle.
- On days 6 and 7, you won’t be having any anti-cancer treatment. Take this time to rest and recover.

### Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.

### Common Side Effects

The following side effects occur in more than 10 out of every 100 people. You might have one or more of them. Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances. Fatigue You may feel tired and find it harder to do daily chores/activities that you usually do or want to do. It may be physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Diarrhoea This treatment may disturb the intestinal lining and cause loose, watery, and more frequent stools than usual. Certain medications have a higher chance of causing diarrhoea. Nausea and/or vomiting Every patient reacts differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication. Hand and foot syndrome Also called palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia) is a side effect of some chemotherapy drugs that can cause  redness, swelling and blistering on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) Platelets help your blood clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count decreases. Let your oncology care team know if you have any excess bruising or bleeding, including nose bleeds, sore gums or blood in your urine or stool. Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia) White blood cells (WBC) are crucial for fighting infection. While receiving treatment, your WBC count can drop, putting you at a higher risk of disease.

- If it is necessary to cut the tablets (e.g. into halves or quarters) to obtain the correct dose,

a tablet cutter should be used. Do not use the same tablet cutter to cut other medicines.

reuse these for further doses, but do not use them for other purposes.

Tell your healthcare team about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements, traditional Chinese medicine and over-the-counter remedies. During treatment, please do not drink the juice of the following fruits, including supplements that may contain them: grapefruit, starfruit, pomegranate and pomelo. They may interfere with the effects of drugs or cause dangerous side effects. As some treatments may weaken your immune system, avoiding raw or undercooked food such as sushi, raw meat, and runny eggs is advisable to prevent infection. Bacteria are often present in uncooked food and are usually killed by the cooking process. If your doctor determines it is safe to eat raw vegetables and fruits, they should be carefully washed. We have dietitian services that can help you plan your diet and meals. Please let a member of your healthcare team know if you are interested. This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is critical not to become pregnant while having treatment and for at least six months afterwards.

Please check with your healthcare team on which immunisations and vaccinations you can take, as this may vary depending on the type of cancer and treatment you are having.

Talk to your healthcare team before starting treatment if you intend to have a baby in the future. It is generally advisable to avoid alcohol while undergoing cancer treatment.
