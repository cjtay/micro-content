### About the treatment

Concurrently given with radiation, capecitabine (antimetabolite chemotherapy) is a treatment option
for colorectal and some other cancers. Radiation and cancer medicines are usually used to slow or stop
cancer cell growth and spread more effectively.

### Side Effects
Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often
cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or
prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences
different side effects to varying degrees.

### Common Side Effects

| Common Side Effect | Full Text Description |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Fatigue | You may feel tired and ﬁnd it harder to do daily chores/activities that you usually do or want to do. It may be physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. |
| Diarrhoea | This treatment may disturb the intestinal lining and cause loose, watery, and more frequent stools than usual. Certain medications have a higher chance of causing diarrhoea. |
| Nausea and/or vomiting | Every patient reacts differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication. |
| Hand and foot syndrome |  |
| Also called palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia) is a side effect of some chemotherapy drugs that can | cause redness, swelling and blistering on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. |
| Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) | Platelets help your blood clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count decreases. Let your oncology care team know if you have any excess bruising or bleeding, including nose bleeds, sore gums or blood in your urine or stool. |
| Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia) | White blood cells (WBC) are crucial for ﬁghting infection. While receiving treatment, your WBC count can drop, putting you at a higher risk of disease. |
