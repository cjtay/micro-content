# Cisplatin and Etoposide with Radiation Q28 Days

### About the treatment

### Treatment details

The concurrent use of chemotherapy, including cisplatin (a platinum-based compound) and etoposide (a topoisomerase inhibitor), with radiation can be effective in certain lung cancer conditions. Radiation and cancer medicines are used together to slow or stop cancer growth and spread.

- Cisplatin and Etoposide will be administered intravenously over ~3 hours

on day 1 of your 28-day cycle.

- Etoposide will be administered intravenously over ~ 30 to 60 mins

on days 2 to 5 of your 28-day cycle.

- Cisplatin will be administered intravenously over ~2 to 3 hours on day 8 of your 28-day cycle.
- Radiation will be administered over ~ 15 to 30 mins, 5 days every week of your 28-day cycle.

(Individual radiation plans may vary somehow from this standard)

- On days 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27 and 28, you won’t have any anti-cancer treatment.

Take this time to rest and recover.

### Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects and that each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.

### Common Side Effects

The following side effects occur in more than 10 out of every 100 people. You might have one or more of them. Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances. Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia) White blood cells (WBCs) are vital for combating infection. During the course of your treatment, your WBC count may decrease, increasing your susceptibility to illness. Low red blood cell count (anaemia) Red blood cells (RBC) are responsible for carrying oxygen to the tissues in your body. When you have a low RBC count, you may feel tired or weak and have pale skin. Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) Platelets help your blood to form a clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count decreases. Inform your oncology care team if you experience any excessive bruising or bleeding, such as nosebleeds, tender gums, or blood in your urine or faeces. Fatigue You may feel weary and find it more challenging to carry out daily tasks/activities that you typically undertake or wish to undertake. It could be physical, emotional, and mental fatigue. Nausea and/or vomiting Every patient responds differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication. Diarrhoea This treatment may disrupt the intestinal lining and cause loose, watery, and more frequent stools than usual. Certain medications have a greater likelihood of causing diarrhoea.

### Other Common Side Effects

- Hearing problems
- Electrolyte imbalance (Monitored by specific blood tests)
- Liver dysfunction (Monitored by specific blood tests)
- Kidney dysfunction (Monitored by specific blood tests)

Constipation This treatment can lead to difficulties in passing faeces. However, constipation may also arise due to other factors, such as reduced physical activity or inadequate nourishment, among other reasons. Hair loss (alopecia) This treatment causes the hair on your head and other body parts to fall. In most cases, hair loss is temporary, and hair grows back to normal after treatment. Low appetite Loss of appetite or reduced appetite are common side effects of cancer and its treatment. This means you may eat less than usual, not feel hungry, or feel full after eating only a small amount. Abdominal pain Pain may be achy or cramp-like and is associated with increased flatulence (gas). Chemotherapy may also alter the normal bacterial flora in the intestines. This can affect digestion and cause abdominal pain, cramping or flatulence (gas).
