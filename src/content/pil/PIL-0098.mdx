### About the treatment
The concurrent use of chemotherapy, including cisplatin (a platinum-based compound) and etoposide
(a topoisomerase inhibitor), with radiation can be effective in certain lung cancer conditions. Radiation
and cancer medicines are used together to slow or stop cancer growth and spread.

### Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often
cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or
prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects and that each person
experiences different side effects to varying degrees.

### Common Side Effects

| Common Side Effect | Full Text Description |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia) | White blood cells (WBCs) are vital for combating infection. During the course of your treatment, your WBC count may decrease, increasing your susceptibility to illness. |
| Low red blood cell count (anaemia) | Red blood cells (RBC) are responsible for carrying oxygen to the tissues in your body. When you have a low RBC count, you may feel tired or weak and have pale skin. |
| Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) | Platelets help your blood to form a clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count decreases. Inform your oncology care team if you experience any excessive bruising or bleeding, such as nosebleeds, tender gums, or blood in your urine or faeces. |
| Fatigue | You may feel weary and ﬁnd it more challenging to carry out daily tasks/activities that you typically undertake or wish to undertake. It could be physical, emotional, and mental fatigue. |
| Nausea and/or vomiting | Every patient responds differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication. |
| Diarrhoea | This treatment may disrupt the intestinal lining and cause loose, watery, and more frequent stools than usual. Certain medications have a greater likelihood of causing diarrhoea. Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances. |
| Constipation | This treatment can lead to difficulties in passing faeces. However, constipation may also arise due to other factors, such as reduced physical activity or inadequate nourishment, among other reasons. |
| Hair loss (alopecia) | This treatment causes the hair on your head and other body parts to fall. In most cases, hair loss is temporary, and hair grows back to normal after treatment. |
| Low appetite | Loss of appetite or reduced appetite are common side effects of cancer and its treatment. This means you may eat less than usual, not feel hungry, or feel full after eating only a small amount. |
| Abdominal pain | Pain may be achy or cramp-like and is associated with increased flatulence (gas). Chemotherapy may also alter the normal bacterial flora in the intestines. This can affect digestion and cause abdominal pain, cramping or flatulence (gas). |

### Other Common Side Effects

- Hearing problems
- Electrolyte imbalance (Monitored by specific blood tests)
- Liver dysfunction (Monitored by specific blood tests)
- Kidney dysfunction (Monitored by specific blood tests)
