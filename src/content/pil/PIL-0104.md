### Side Effects
Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often
cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or
prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences
different side effects to varying degrees.

### Common Side Effects

| Common Side Effect | Full Text Description |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) | Platelets help your blood clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count decreases. Let your oncology care team know if you have any excess bruising or bleeding, including nose bleeds, sore gums or blood in your urine or stool. |
| Low red blood cell count (anaemia) | Red blood cells (RBC) are responsible for carrying oxygen to the tissues in your body. When you have a low RBC count, you may feel tired or weak and have pale skin. |
| Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia) | White blood cells (WBC) are crucial for ﬁghting infection. While receiving treatment, your WBC count can drop, putting you at a higher risk of disease. |
| Allergic reactions | You may have an allergic reaction to this medication. Symptoms usually include rash, itching, dizziness, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, sudden blood pressure changes or oedema (swelling). |
| Diarrhoea | This treatment may disturb the intestinal lining and cause loose, watery, and more frequent stools than usual. Certain medications have a higher chance of causing diarrhoea. |
| Pain | Chemotherapy can result in various physical side effects, including cramps and pain in the muscles (myalgia), joints (arthralgia) and bones (ostealgia). Pain may be mild and intermittent, or persistent and severe. |
| Nausea and/or vomiting | Every patient reacts differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication. Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances. |
| Hot flushes | You may feel sudden warmth in the upper body, especially over the face, neck and chest. You may also feel redness and sweating. |
| Hair loss (alopecia) | This treatment causes the hair on your head and other body parts to fall. In most cases, hair loss is temporary, and hair grows back to normal after treatment. |
| Low appetite | Appetite loss or poor appetite are common side effects of cancer and its treatment. This means you may eat less than usual, not feel hungry, or feel full after eating only a tiny amount. |
