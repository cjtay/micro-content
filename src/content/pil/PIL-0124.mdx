Cyclophosphamide (alkylating agent), methotrexate (antimetabolite) and fluorouracil (antimetabolite) are used together to treat particular breast cancer conditions effectively.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
