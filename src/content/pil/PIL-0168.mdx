# Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide and Pembrolizumab Q21 Days

## About the treatment

A combination of doxorubicin (anthracycline), cyclophosphamide (alkylating agent) and pembrolizumab (monoclonal antibody) is an effective treatment option in particular breast cancer conditions. Cancer medicines are often used in combination to provide greater efficiency in slowing down or stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
