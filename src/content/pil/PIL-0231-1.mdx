## About the treatment

Goserelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that works as a hormonal therapy. In men, it is used to treat prostate cancer. It blocks the release of specific hormones, LH and FSH, decreasing testosterone production. Goserelin slows down or stops the growth of cancer cells that require testosterone. In women, it is used to treat breast cancer. It blocks the release of specific hormones, LH and FSH, which decrease oestrogen production. Goserelin slows down or stops the growth of cancer cells that require oestrogen to grow.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
