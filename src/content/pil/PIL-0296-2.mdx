title: "PIL-0296-2"
description: "Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that works as an immunotherapy. It binds to a specific type of protein, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) present on the surface of immune cells and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2 sites. This triggers the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. It is given in breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer and gynaecological cancer."

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
