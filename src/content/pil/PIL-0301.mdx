# Olaparib

## About the treatment

Olaparib is a poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that works as a targeted therapy. The specific types of PARP proteins help BRCA-mutated cancer cells grow and spread. Olaparib stops the growth of cancer cells by blocking the activity of PARP. It is given for breast, gynaecological, pancreatic, and prostate cancer.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
