### About the treatment

A combination of paclitaxel (microtubule inhibitor), pertuzumab (monoclonal antibody), and
trastuzumab (monoclonal antibody) is an effective treatment option for breast cancer. When cancer
drugs are combined, they become more efficient at stopping cancer cell growth and spreading.

### Treatment details

•   Paclitaxel and Pertuzumab will be administered intravenously ~ 1.5 to 2 hours
on day 1 of your 21-day cycle.
•   Trastuzumab will be administered subcutaneously ~2 to 5 minutes on day 1 of your 21-day cycle.
•   Paclitaxel will be administered intravenously ~ 60 minutes on days 8 and 15 of your 21-day cycle.
•   From days 2 to 7, days 9 to 14 and days 16 to 21, you won’t have any anti-cancer treatment.
Take this time to rest and recover. (Except on days 8 and 15 when you will have a paclitaxel dose).

### Side Effects
Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often
cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or
prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences
different side effects to varying degrees.

### Common Side Effects

| Common Side Effect | Full Text Description |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) | Platelets help your blood clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count decreases. Let your oncology care team know if you have any excess bruising or bleeding, including nose bleeds, sore gums or blood in your urine or stool. |
| Low red blood cell count (anaemia) | Red blood cells (RBC) are responsible for carrying oxygen to the tissues in your body. When you have a low RBC count, you may feel tired or weak and have pale skin. |
| Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia) | White blood cells (WBC) are crucial for ﬁghting infection. While receiving treatment, your WBC count can drop, putting you at a higher risk of disease. |
| Allergic reactions | You may have an allergic reaction to this medication. Symptoms usually include rash, itching, dizziness, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, sudden blood pressure changes or oedema (swelling). |
| Nausea and/or vomiting | Every patient reacts differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication. |
| Peripheral neuropathy/neurotoxicity | Peripheral neuropathy is due to damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. These nerves carry information from the brain to other parts of the body. The usual symptoms are numbness, tingling, and weakness in the extremities like hands and feet. |
| Fatigue | You may feel tired and ﬁnd it harder to do daily chores/activities that you usually do or want to do. It may be physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances. |
| Mouth sores | Cancer medications can cause sores in the mouth and throat. These sores are painful and may become infected. |
| Flu-like symptoms | Some types of chemotherapy can cause ﬂu-like symptoms within a few hours of treatment. These symptoms generally last for 2 to 3 days. Some types of immunotherapy increase your body’s natural immune response, which can cause mild to severe ﬂu-like symptoms. |
| Joint pain | Pain is a common side effect of chemotherapy, and joint pain is no exception. Although it can occur anytime during treatment, it often appears afterwards and is usually resolved in weeks to months. |

### Other Common Side Effects

- Skin problems (rash, itch), nail problems
- Lungs/breathing problems (cough, shortness of breath)
- Dry skin
