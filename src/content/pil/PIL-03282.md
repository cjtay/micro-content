# About the treatment
### Treatment details
A combination of paclitaxel (microtubule inhibitor), pertuzumab (monoclonal antibody), and  trastuzumab (monoclonal antibody) is an effective treatment option for breast cancer. When cancer  drugs are combined, they become more efficient at stopping cancer cell growth and spreading.
- Paclitaxel and Pertuzumab will be administered intravenously ~ 1.5 to 2 hours  on day 1 of your 21-day cycle.
- Trastuzumab will be administered subcutaneously ~2 to 5 minutes on day 1 of your 21-day cycle.
- Paclitaxel will be administered intravenously ~ 60 minutes on days 8 and 15 of your 21-day cycle.
- From days 2 to 7, days 9 to 14 and days 16 to 21, you won’t have any anti-cancer treatment.
Take this time to rest and recover. (Except on days 8 and 15 when you will have a paclitaxel dose).

# Side Effects

![PIL-03282 - Side Effects](/src/assets/images/PIL-03282/PIL-03282_image01.jpg)

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often  cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or  prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences  different side effects to varying degrees.
### Common Side Effects
The following side effects occur in more than 10 out of every 100 people.
You might have one or more of them.
Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider  to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances.
### Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
Platelets help your blood clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count  decreases. Let your oncology care team know if you have any excess bruising or bleeding, including  nose bleeds, sore gums or blood in your urine or stool.
### Low red blood cell count (anaemia)
Red blood cells (RBC) are responsible for carrying oxygen to the tissues in your body. When you  have a low RBC count, you may feel tired or weak and have pale skin.
### Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia)
White blood cells (WBC) are crucial for fighting infection. While receiving treatment, your WBC count  can drop, putting you at a higher risk of disease.
### Allergic reactions
You may have an allergic reaction to this medication. Symptoms usually include rash, itching, dizziness,  vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, sudden blood pressure changes or oedema (swelling).
### Nausea and/or vomiting
Every patient reacts differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also  experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication.
### Peripheral neuropathy/neurotoxicity
Peripheral neuropathy is due to damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. These  nerves carry information from the brain to other parts of the body. The usual symptoms are  numbness, tingling, and weakness in the extremities like hands and feet.
### Fatigue
You may feel tired and find it harder to do daily chores/activities that you usually do or want to do.
It may be physical, emotional and mental exhaustion.

Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider  to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances.
### Mouth sores
Cancer medications can cause sores in the mouth and throat. These sores are painful and may become  infected.
### Flu-like symptoms
Some types of chemotherapy can cause flu-like symptoms within a few hours of treatment. These  symptoms generally last for 2 to 3 days. Some types of immunotherapy increase your body’s natural  immune response, which can cause mild to severe flu-like symptoms.
### Joint pain
Pain is a common side effect of chemotherapy, and joint pain is no exception. Although it can occur  anytime during treatment, it often appears afterwards and is usually resolved in weeks to months.

Tell your healthcare team about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins,   herbal supplements, traditional Chinese medicine and over-the-counter remedies. During  treatment, please do not drink the juice of the following fruits, including supplements that  may contain them: grapefruit, starfruit, pomegranate and pomelo. They may interfere with  the effects of drugs or cause dangerous side effects.
As some treatments may weaken your immune system, avoiding raw or undercooked food  such as sushi, raw meat, and runny eggs is advisable to prevent infection. Bacteria are often  present in uncooked food and are usually killed by the cooking process. If your doctor  determines it is safe to eat raw vegetables and fruits, they should be carefully washed.
We have dietitian services that can help you plan your diet and meals. Please let a member  of your healthcare team know if you are interested.
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is critical not to become pregnant  while having treatment and for at least six months afterwards. Before starting treatment,  talk to your healthcare team about effective contraception (for both male and female part- ners). Do not breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may pass through your  breast milk.
You may have immunisations and vaccinations to protect your health. Please check with  your healthcare team on which immunisations and vaccinations you can take, as this may  vary depending on the type of cancer and treatment you are having.
