# Pembrolizumab Q21 Days

## About the treatment

Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works as an immunotherapy. The drug inhibits the activity of a specific protein in immune cells, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This PD-1 binds to PD-L1 and PD-L2 in cancer cells and causes cancer cell growth. Pembrolizumab binds to PD-1 and triggers the immune system to kill cancer cells.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
