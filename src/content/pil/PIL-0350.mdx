# Ribociclib

## About the treatment

Ribociclib is a selective kinase inhibitor that works as a targeted therapy and treats breast cancer. Ribociclib slows down or stops the growth and spread of cancer cells by blocking the activity of a specific type of protein, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK 4, 6).

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
