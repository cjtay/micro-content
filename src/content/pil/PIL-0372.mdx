# Sacituzumab Govitecan

## About the treatment

Sacituzumab govitecan contains two medicines sacituzumab (monoclonal antibody) and govitecan (chemotherapy- topoisomerase inhibitor). It binds to cancer cells that have a high concentration of a specific type of protein called humanized antitrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2. (TROP-2). This protein promotes cancer cell growth and division. Once sacituzumab govitecan binds to TROP-2, its active chemotherapy drug enters cancer cells and destroys them. It also harms neighbouring cancer cells.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
