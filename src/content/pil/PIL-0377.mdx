# Tamoxifen

## About the treatment

Tamoxifen is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator that works as a hormonal therapy. It is used to treat breast cancer. Tamoxifen blocks the effect of oestrogen, a hormone produced by the body, and slows down or stops cancer cells that require oestrogen to grow.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
