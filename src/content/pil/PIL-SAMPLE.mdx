# Sample Treatment Protocol

## About the treatment

Concurrently given with radiation, capecitabine (antimetabolite chemotherapy) is a treatment option for colorectal and some other cancers. Radiation and cancer medicines are usually used to slow or stop cancer cell growth and spread more effectively.

## Side Effects

Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences different side effects to varying degrees.
