### About the treatment

A combination of capecitabine (antimetabolite) and lapatinib (kinase inhibitor) is a treatment option for
breast cancer. Cancer medicines are often used in combination to slow down or stop the growth and
spread of cancer cells.

### Side Effects
Chemotherapy is often linked to so many side effects. While it is true that chemotherapy drugs often
cause a wide range of side effects, most of these side effects are temporary and can be minimised or
prevented. Remember that different drugs cause different side effects, and each person experiences
different side effects to varying degrees.

### Common Side Effects

| Common Side Effect | Full Text Description |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Diarrhoea | This treatment may disturb the intestinal lining and cause loose, watery, and more frequent stools than usual. Certain medications have a higher chance of causing diarrhoea. |
| Hand and foot syndrome |  |
| Also called palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia) is a side effect of some chemotherapy drugs that can | cause redness, swelling and blistering on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. |
| Low white blood cell count (Leukopenia or Neutropenia) | White blood cells (WBC) are crucial for ﬁghting infection. While receiving treatment, your WBC count can drop, putting you at a higher risk of disease. |
| Nausea and/or vomiting | Every patient reacts differently to cancer medication. Many people feel nauseous, and some also experience vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be managed or reduced with medication. |
| Fatigue | You may feel tired and ﬁnd it harder to do daily chores/activities that you usually do or want to do. It may be physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. |
| Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) | Platelets help your blood clot, so you are at a higher risk of bleeding when your platelet count decreases. Let your oncology care team know if you have any excess bruising or bleeding, including nose bleeds, sore gums or blood in your urine or stool. |
| Low appetite | Appetite loss or poor appetite are common side effects of cancer and its treatment. This means you may eat less than usual, not feel hungry, or feel full after eating only a tiny amount. Patient Information Use and Disclaimer: this is not a complete list of side effects. Always consult your healthcare provider to ensure the information displayed on this page applies to your personal circumstances. |
| Nail changes | Your nails may take on a bruised appearance, turning various shades of black, brown, purple, blue and green. Blemishes, such as horizontal and vertical lines and small indentations, may develop on your nails in response to different cycles of chemotherapy. |
| Joint pain | Pain is a common side effect of chemotherapy, and joint pain is no exception. Although it can occur anytime during treatment, it often appears afterwards and is usually resolved in weeks to months. |
